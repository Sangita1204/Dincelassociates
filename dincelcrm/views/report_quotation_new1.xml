							<li>The "agreement" means these terms and conditions and the contents of the accompanying letter.</li>
							<li>The Consulting Engineer shall provide to the Client the consulting engineering services ("services") described in the accompanying letter. </li>
							<li>In providing the services, the Consulting Engineer shall exercise the degree of skill, care and diligence normally exercised by consulting engineers in similar circumstances and the Client shall provide to the Consulting Engineer briefing and all information concerning the Client's requirement for the commission.</li>
							<li>All monies payable by the Client to the Consulting Engineer shall be paid within 14 days of date of invoice unless otherwise nominated in the accompanying letter.  Moneys not paid within that period shall attract interest from the date of invoice until payment at the rate of 1% per month on the outstanding balance. The Client must pay the legal costs and disbursements on a full indemnity basis suffered or incurred by the Consulting Engineer as a result of any default by the Client of its obligations under this agreement.</li>
							
							<li>The liability of the Consulting Engineer to the Client in respect of the services shall be limited to the cost of rectifying the services provided or the sum of $1 million, whichever is the lesser.</li>

<li>Copyright in all drawings and documents prepared by the Consulting Engineer in connection with the services shall be the property of the Client upon final payment of the whole of the monies specified in the accompanying letter and any other monies payable under the agreement.</li>

<li>Subject to the following, the Client alone shall have a non-transferable licence to use the documents referred to above for the sole purpose of completing the project for which the drawings and documents were prepared but shall not be entitled to make copies of the said drawings and documents.</li>

<li>If the Client is in breach of any obligation to make a payment to the Consulting Engineer, the Consulting Engineer may revoke the licence, and the Client shall immediately cease to use the drawings and documents prepared or provided by the Consulting Engineer  and immediately return them to the Consulting Engineer and all copies (authorised or not).</li>

<li>The Client indemnifies the Consulting Engineer against all claims, demands, actions, suits, proceedings, loss, costs, damages, injuries or expenses suffered or incurred by the Consulting Engineer (including, without limitation, legal costs and disbursements on a full indemnity basis) as a result of:<br />
(a)	the Client relying upon uncompleted drawings and/or documents;<br />
(b)	any modifications to the drawings and/or documents made without the approval of the Consulting Engineer;<br />
(c)	any third party relying upon the drawings and/or documents otherwise than in connection with the project for which the services are provided.</li>

<li>To the fullest extent permitted by law, all implied terms, conditions and warranties are hereby excluded and the Consulting Engineer shall not be liable to the Client for any indirect or consequential loss, loss of profits or business opportunities or other similar contingencies.</li>

<li>All indemnities and limitations of liability in favour of the Consulting Engineer also extend to its staff.</li>

<li>Either the Client or the Consulting Engineer may terminate this agreement upon the expiration of reasonable notice given in writing.  The Consulting Engineer may terminate this agreement immediately if any amount is not paid by the due date. The Client may terminate, and the Consulting Engineer may suspend its obligations or terminate, this agreement immediately if the other party:<br />
(a)	is wound up or made bankrupt;<br />
(b)	has a receiver, manager, receiver and manager, administrator, controller, liquidator or provisional liquidator appointed;<br />
(c)	enters into any scheme or arrangement with its creditors;<br />
(d)	commits a breach (other than payment of monies) which is able to be remedied but not done so within 14 days of a request to do so;<br />
(e)	commits a breach that is not capable of remedy or is a breach of an essential term.</li>

<li>The Client shall be deemed to have terminated this agreement if the property the subject of the project is sold, proposed to be sold or is advertised for sale before the development approval and construction certificate (that relate to the services provided by the Consulting Engineer) is issued by building approval authority for the property.</li>

<li>Where this agreement is terminated by the Client, other than because of the default of the Consulting Engineer, or is terminated by the Consulting Engineer, the Consulting Engineer shall be entitled to reimbursement for any loss and expense reasonably incurred and loss of an expectation of a profit in contemplation of completing the services, the latter of which shall be equal to 25% of the difference between the value of the services performed up to that time and the total amount payable under this agreement.</li>
<li>If the Consulting Engineer considers it appropriate, he may with the Client’s prior approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, engage another consultant to assist the Consulting Engineer in specialist areas.  The client accepts responsibility for all monies payable to such other consultant.</li>
<li>Any variations to the services stated in the accompanying letter or any additional consultants to be engaged shall be at the additional expense of the Client and the Consulting Engineer may suspend its obligations if the Client unreasonably refuses to sign any acknowledgement of the additional expense.</li>

<li>Neither party may assign its rights or obligations under this agreement without the prior written consent of the other party and such assignment shall not release that party from any rights the other party had or may have had against it.</li>

<li>By signing the attached fee agreement the client agrees that the fee shall be increased by 10% per annum should the commissioned works not be finalised within twelve (12) months of the approval of the fee letter due to reasons beyond the engineer’s control.</li>
